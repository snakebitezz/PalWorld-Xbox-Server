# PalWorld-Xbox-Server


It is Self explanitory in the title of this article what we are trying to achieve here but here is where I intend to post the files required or at least the ones I use on my setup.

If there is a field where I need to censor out my private settings such as password I will make sure to bold and make it obvious as some guides do not make it clear enough IMHO


I need to give credit where it is due the following sites are where I started and none this "worked" out of the box. I want to say I am very thankful for their contribution of my quest.
